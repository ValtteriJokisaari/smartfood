SMARTFOOD: An LLM-Driven Ubiquitous Mobile App for Context-Aware Restaurant Recommendation

## Description
SMARTFOOD is an open-source, context-aware Android app that combines detailed user profiles (dietary restrictions, allergies, taste preferences, health status) with nutritional data from Finlandâ€™s Fineli database and a fine-tuned language model to deliver personalized, lower-calorie restaurant-level recommendations for any dining scenario. The project aims to address challenges such as managing dynamic and expanding restaurant menus, integrating nutritional databases, and simplifying user engagement. By utilizing LLM-based text analysis, common datasets, and user feedback, the app will promote healthier dining choices and tailored food recommendations.

The project focuses on creating a scalable, user-friendly platform with advanced recommendation features powered by artificial intelligence. The project provides better choices for the consumer which will impact their health positively.
